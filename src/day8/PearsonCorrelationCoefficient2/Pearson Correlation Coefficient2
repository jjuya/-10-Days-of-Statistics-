The regression line of y on x is 3x+4y+8=0, 
and the regression line of x on y is 4x+3y+7=0. 
What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

1) 1
2) -1
3) 3/4
4) -4/3
5) 4/3
6) -3/4

y = -2 + (-3/4) * x 
x = -7/4 + (-3/4) * y
-> a = -3/4, b = -3/4

p = a (x_std / y_std)
p = b (y_std / x_std)

p^2 = b1 * b2 
p^2 = (-3/4) * (-3/4) 
p^2 = 9/16 
p = 3/4 or -3/4

x and y are negatively correlated by definition > -3/4
