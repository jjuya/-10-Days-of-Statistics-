/*
 * The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. 
 * For each dayâ€™s operation:
 * 
 * The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88. 
 * The daily cost of operating A is C = 160 + 40X^2.
 * 
 * The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55. 
 * The daily cost of operating B is C = 128 + 40Y^2.
 * 
 * Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure that they operate like new at the start of each day. 
 * Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
 * 
 * Input format
 * A single line comprised of 2 space-separated values denoting the respective means for A and B:
 * 
 * 	0.88 1.55
 * 	
 * Output format
 * 	On the first line, print the expected daily cost of machine A.
 *  On the second line, print the expected daily cost of machine B.
