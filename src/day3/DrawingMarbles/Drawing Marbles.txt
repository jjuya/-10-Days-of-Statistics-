A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. 
Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

1) 1/12
2) 7/12
3) 1/6
4) 2/3

첫 공이 빨간공  : 3/7
두번쨰 공이 파란공 : 4/6

(# of blue marbles) / (total # of marbles)
= 4 / (2 + 4)
= 2/3
