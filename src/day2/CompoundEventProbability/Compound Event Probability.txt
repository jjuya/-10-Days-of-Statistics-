There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, Z
- Urn Xcontains 4red balls and 3black balls.
- Urn Ycontains 5red balls and 4black balls.
- Urn Zcontains 4red balls and 4black balls. 
One ball is drawn from each of the 3urns. 
What is the probability that, 
of the 3balls drawn, 2are red and 1is. black?

1) 10/63
2) 2/7
3) 17/42
4) 31/126


○○○○ 4/7	●●● 3/7
○○○○○ 5/9	●●●● 4/9
○○○○ 1/2	●●●● 1/2

4/7 * 5/9 * 1/2 = 20/126
4/7 * 4/9 * 1/2 = 16/126
3/7 * 5/9 * 1/2 = 15/126
